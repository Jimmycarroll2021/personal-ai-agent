# AI Agent Architecture Research Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the research findings on AI agent architecture, focusing on creating a personal AI agent similar to Manus AI. The research covers core components, LLM integration approaches, tool frameworks, planning and knowledge modules, and compute requirements.

## Core Components of AI Agent Architecture

### 1. Agent Core/Brain
- Serves as the main controller or "brain" that coordinates the flow of operations
- Activated using a prompt template with important details about operation and tools
- Contains general goals, tool descriptions, planning module explanations, and relevant memory
- Can be profiled or assigned a persona to define its role and behavior
- Acts as the central coordination module managing core logic and behavioral characteristics

### 2. Planning Module
- Helps break down necessary steps or subtasks to solve user requests
- Enables better reasoning about problems and reliably finding solutions
- Planning approaches:
  - **Planning Without Feedback**: Uses techniques like Chain of Thought (CoT) and Tree of Thoughts (ToT)
  - **Planning With Feedback**: Uses mechanisms like ReAct and Reflexion that enable iterative reflection and refinement
  - **Task Decomposition**: Breaking complex questions into simpler sub-parts
  - **Reflection/Critic**: Refining execution plans based on feedback

### 3. Memory Module
- Stores the agent's internal logs including past thoughts, actions, and observations
- Types of memory:
  - **Short-term memory**: Context information about current situations (in-context learning)
  - **Long-term memory**: Past behaviors and thoughts retained over extended periods (external vector store)
  - **Hybrid memory**: Combines both for improved long-range reasoning
- Memory formats include natural language, embeddings, databases, and structured lists
- Retrieval uses composite scoring based on semantic similarity, importance, recency, etc.

### 4. Tools Integration
- Enables the LLM agent to interact with external environments
- Examples: Search APIs, Code Interpreters, Math Engines, databases, knowledge bases
- Executed via workflows that assist the agent in obtaining observations
- Approaches:
  - MRKL: Combines LLMs with expert modules
  - Toolformer: Fine-tunes LLMs to use external tool APIs
  - Function Calling: Augments LLMs with tool use capability

## LLM Integration - DeepSeek-R1

### Model Architecture
- DeepSeek-R1 is a family of models including DeepSeek-R1-Zero and DeepSeek-R1
- Full model features 671 billion parameters using mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture
- Distilled versions range from 1.5 billion to 70 billion parameters based on Qwen and Llama architectures

### Training Methodology
- Uses reinforcement learning through group relative policy optimization (GRPO)
- DeepSeek-R1 follows a multi-stage approach:
  1. Supervised fine-tuning with high-quality examples
  2. Reinforcement learning focused on reasoning tasks
  3. Rejection sampling to collect new training data
  4. Final reinforcement learning across all task types

### Hardware Requirements
- Full Model: Requires high-end GPU (RTX 3090 or better) or CPU with 48GB RAM
- Distilled Models: More accessible, with 7B version running on 6GB VRAM GPU or 4GB RAM CPU
- For TPU optimization (based on knowledge items):
  - Use DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B instead of smaller 1.5B model
  - Configure for BFloat16 precision (optimized for TPUs)
  - Utilize tensor parallelism across multiple TPU cores
  - Increase maximum context length to 32K tokens

### Deployment Options
1. Web Access via DeepSeek Chat Platform
2. API Integration (OpenAI-compatible API)
3. Local Deployment using:
   - Ollama
   - vLLM/SGLang
   - llama.cpp

## Tool Integration Frameworks
- Function calling for defining tool APIs and providing them to the model
- Tool execution workflows that assist the agent in obtaining observations
- RAG pipelines for knowledge retrieval and context generation
- Code interpreters for executing code and solving complex tasks
- API integrations for external services

## Compute Optimization Strategies
- Model distillation to reduce parameter count while maintaining capabilities
- Quantization techniques (GGML, GGUF, GPTQ)
- TPU-specific optimizations:
  - BFloat16 precision for better numerical stability
  - Tensor parallelism across multiple cores
  - Memory optimizations for TPU architecture
- Context length optimization for processing longer documents

## Conclusion
The research findings provide a comprehensive understanding of AI agent architecture and the components needed to build a personal AI agent similar to Manus AI. The next step is to design a system architecture that incorporates these components and optimizes for the specific requirements of a personal AI agent.
